      <h3>Here is alittle bit about me</h3>
      <p>
        Hello my relatives, I am a amateur photographer based in Phoenix,
        Arizona. I'm from Tonalea, Arizona which is in the Great Navajo Nation.
        I am Navajo, so my first clan is Bitter Water and I am born for the
        Mescalero Apache people. I've started taking photos in 2015 attending
        high school in Farmington, New Mexico. I only recently started taking
        photos again, since then I have taken a few portraits, with a main focus
        on landscapes.
